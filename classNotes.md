# Azure Data Engineering: Core Concepts and Architecture

## Azure Data Factory (ADF)
**Primary Purpose**: Orchestration and data movement service
- Used primarily for extraction and loading (EL)
- Transformation in ADF is cost-inefficient; prefer Databricks/PySpark

### Key Components
1. **Dataset**
   - Pointer/reference to source or sink (target)
   - Defines structure and location of data

2. **Linked Service**
   - Connection string for source/sink connectivity
   - Contains credentials, endpoints, authentication details

3. **Activities**
   - Logical units of work
   - Types: Copy, ForEach, Wait, etc.

4. **Pipeline**
   - Container for organized activities
   - Defines complete data workflow

5. **Integration Runtime (IR)**
   - Provides computation infrastructure
   - Types:
     - Azure IR (default): Public-to-public network connections
     - Self-hosted IR: Private-to-public network connections
     - SSIS IR: For SSIS package execution

6. **Triggers**
   - Schedule pipeline execution
   - Types:
     - Scheduled
     - Event-based
     - Tumbling window

### Self-hosted IR Setup Process
1. Access ADF portal → Manage → Integration Runtime
2. Create new Self-hosted IR
3. Download and install runtime locally
4. Generate and save authentication keys
5. Configure runtime with keys
6. Verify "Running" status in ADF

## Medallion Architecture
A layered approach to data organization and processing:

### Bronze Layer (Raw)
- Exact copy of source data
- No modifications
- Serves as backup/archive
- Handles all data types (structured, semi-structured, unstructured)

### Silver Layer (Curated)
- First level of transformation
- Operations:
  - Column renaming
  - Data type standardization
  - Null value handling
  - Basic cleaning and validation
  - Stores preprocessed data.

### Gold Layer (Business)
- Advanced transformations
- Features:
  - Aggregations
  - Window functions
  - Complex joins
  - Business logic implementation
- Optimized for end-user consumption (analysts, data scientists)

## Data Types and Sources

### Data Types
1. **Structured**
   - Tabular format (rows/columns)
   - Examples: SQL tables, CSV files

2. **Semi-structured**
   - Key-value pairs or tagged data
   - Examples: JSON, XML

3. **Unstructured**
   - No predefined structure
   - Examples: PDFs, images, audio files

### Common Sources and Targets
- Sources:
  - SQL Server
  - REST APIs
  - SFTP
- Targets:
  - Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)

## Data Warehouse vs. Data Lake

### Data Warehouse
- ETL-based workflow
- Primarily structured data
- Limited versioning capabilities

### Data Lake
- ELT-based workflow
- Supports all data types
- Enhanced versioning (Delta tables)
- More flexible for diverse analytics

## Azure Technology Stack
- **Azure Data Factory**: Data orchestration
- **Azure Data Lake Storage**: Data storage
- **Azure Key Vault**: Security management
- **Azure Databricks**: Data processing
- **Languages**: Python (PySpark), SQL, Scala

## Important Notes
- Always consider cost implications of transformation operations
- Implement proper security measures using Key Vault
- Follow naming conventions consistently
- Document data lineage across layers
- Regular monitoring of IR status
